<body>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Cover Page
	</div>
<br>
	Include Date, Name, Class, Teacher, Period, Title
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Problem
	</div>
<br>
	The purpose section should identify the scientific and educational reasons for performing the experiment.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Objective
	</div>
<br>
	Hypotheses are testable explanations of a problem, phenomenon, or observation. Both quantitative and qualitative research involve formulating a hypothesis to address the research problem. Hypotheses that suggest a causal relationship involve at least one independent variable and at least one dependent variable; in other words, one variable which is presumed to affect the other. Hypotheses should be writen in an If-Then statement and in future tense.

	<div class="bold">
		Introduction
	</div>
<br>
	Provides the reader with background knowledge to the experiment. A good introduction also provides whatever background theory, previous research, or formulas the reader needs to know. Usually, an instructor does not want you to repeat the lab manual, but to show your own comprehension of the problem.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Materials
	</div>
<br>
	List the materials used in the experiment in a bulleted list. Be specific with each item.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Procedure/ Methods
	</div>
<br>
	Make a list of steps that were used to complete the experiment. This list should be in chronological order and very descriptive. This can also be written as a narrative describing, in detail, the methods used to exectue the experiment. 
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Data/ Graph
	</div>
<br>
	Make a data table of the qualitative or quantitative data. It should be properly labeled and easy to read. Observations should also be very detailed. If the the experiment had quantitative data, a properly labeled graph should be made. The independant variable is on the x axis and the dependent variable in on the y axis.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Data Analysis/ Calculations
	</div>
<br>
	After the data, include a discussion of the results. This should be fairly detailed, including numbers from the tables and graphs. There may be a theoretical prediction, which needs to be checked against the data; so we might calculate a percent error and use that to decide whether or not the lab confirms the equation or theory. This should be a detailed analysis that does not attempt to give the reader the “big picture,” but a certain amount of discussion may be appropriate, to explain what the numbers mean and what the results say about the procedure we used.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<div class="bold">
		Conclusion
	</div>
<br>
	After a description of the results in detail, there should be a brief but comprehensive statement of what the lab achieved, usually no more than one paragraph. Does the experiment support or not support the hypothesis. This should relate specifically to the goals stated in the introduction. Can we confirm the equation or theory, based on the detailed results given above? Does the system or material really have a constant property as expected? Did the lab equipment and procedure serve the purpose well or not? Here is the place for global conclusions; the detailed numbers have already been provided in the analysis portion of the report.

	<div class="bold">
		Work Cited
	</div>
<br>
	A full citation of all literature referred to in the paper must be included at the end of your paper in MLA format.
