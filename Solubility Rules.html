		Solubility Rules
	</h1>
	<h2>
		The following are the solubility rules for common ionic solids. If there two rules appear to contradict each other, the preceding rule takes precedence.
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Salts containing Group I elements (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>) are soluble . There are few exceptions to this rule. Salts containing the ammonium ion (NH<sup>4+</sup>) are also soluble. </li>
		<li>Salts containing nitrate ion (NO<sup>3-</sup>) are generally soluble. </li>
		<li>Salts containing Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, or I<sup>-</sup> are generally soluble. Important exceptions to this rule are halide salts of Ag<sup>+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and (Hg<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, AgCl, PbBr<sub>2</sub>, and Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> are insoluble. </li>
		<li>Most silver salts are insoluble. AgNO<sub>3</sub> and Ag(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are common soluble salts of silver; virtually all others are insoluble. </li>
		<li>Most sulfate salts are soluble. Important exceptions to this rule include CaSO<sub>4</sub>, BaSO<sub>4</sub>, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and SrSO<sub>4</sub>. </li>
		<li>Most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group I elements are soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group II elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of transition metals and Al<sup>3+</sup> are insoluble. Thus, Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> are not soluble. </li>
		<li>Most sulfides of transition metals are highly insoluble, including CdS, FeS, ZnS, and Ag<sub>2</sub>S. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead sulfides are also insoluble. </li>
		<li>Carbonates are frequently insoluble. Group II carbonates (CaCO<sub>3</sub>, SrCO<sub>3</sub>, and BaCOâ€‹<sub>3</sub>) are insoluble, as are FeCO<sub>3</sub> and PbCO<sub>3</sub>. </li>
		<li>Chromates are frequently insoluble. Examples include PbCrO4 and BaCrO4.</li>
		<li>Phosphates such as Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> are frequently insoluble.</li>
		<li>Fluorides such as BaF<sub>2</sub>, MgF<sub>2</sub>, and PbF<sub>2</sub> are frequently insoluble.</li>
